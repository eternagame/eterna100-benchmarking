This repository contains RNA design algorithm solutions for the Eterna100-V1 and Eterna100-V2.

Each subdirectory has that algorithm's solutions to Eterna100-V1 and Eterna100-V2 (eternabrain/ has 2 files, one with Vienna 1 solutions and the other with Vienna 2 solutions).

`eterna100v1_vienna1.tsv` and `eterna100v2_vienna2.tsv` contain structures, Eterna puzzle information, and valid solutions for all version 1 structures solved using vienna 1.8.5 and all version 2 structures solved using vienna 2.1.9, respectively.

`scripts/` contains information on how to reproduce these results for every algorithm.
