# Eterna100 Benchmarking

[![Paper](https://img.shields.io/badge/paper-bioRxiv-a82525)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.26.457839v1)

This repository contains RNA design algorithm solutions for the Eterna100-V1 and Eterna100-V2.

Each subdirectory has that algorithm's solutions to Eterna100-V1 and Eterna100-V2 (eternabrain/ has 2 files, one with Vienna 1 solutions and the other with Vienna 2 solutions).

`eterna100_vienna1.txt` and `eterna100_vienna2.txt` contain puzzle IDs, structures, and attempted player solutions.

`eterna100-v2-19-pids.txt` contains puzzle IDs for the original and new 19 redesigned puzzles that weren't solvable in Vienna 1. `eterna100-v2-19-solutions.csv` contains player solutions for each of the IDs in `eterna100-v2-19-pids.txt`.

`scripts/` contains information on how to reproduce these results for every algorithm.

## TODO
Scripts for running NEMO still need to be uploaded.
